## Description 
processor.v contains the outline for a simple processor. A 16 bit model is used here. 
Separate modules for a State Machine, ALU, Multiplexer, Clock Dividor, and Registers have been built. 

All modules are combined to form a processor in the Processor module. "netlist.pdf" shows the diagram of 
the connections of the processor. 

"processor.v" is the top module for now. 
 

## Reference
Followed the guide on "reference.pdf".
